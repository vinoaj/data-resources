## SQL Parsers
- [SQLGlot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot): "_a no dependency Python SQL parser, transpiler, and optimizer. It can be used to format SQL or translate between different dialects like Presto, Spark, and Hive. It aims to read a wide variety of SQL inputs and output syntatically correct SQL in the targeted dialects_"
- [More SQL Parsing](https://github.com/klahnakoski/mo-sql-parsing): "_convert SQL queries to JSON-izable parse trees_"
- [sqloxide](https://github.com/wseaton/sqloxide): "_The original goal of this project was to have a very fast, efficient, and accurate SQL parser I could use for building data lineage graphs across large code bases (think hundreds of auto-generated .sql files)_"
